Overview
========
Google project zero targets for security loop holes in Broadcom wifi chip.

WICED WWD was written completely separately from DHD but it is in our best interests to ensure that any exploits
identified by Google on DHD are not also present in WWD. Unfortunately this is not just an application of patches
as the code bases are so different but instead requires reviewing the WWD code to understand if there are similar
operations (stack overflows, buffer overflows etc.) exploitable on the WWD.

The following exploits have been analyzed and  found that only one of them is applicable to the WICED host side.

The firmware security patches are common for DHD as well as WICED and it has been applied to the firmware release.
